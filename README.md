# Drawing-App
This project is a drawing canvas which users can use during their leisure time to relax and unwind while they draw pictures. The app allows the user to change the size of the drawing line. It also allows the user to change the color of the drawing line.There is a reset button for the user to clear what is previously drawn and start from a blank canvas. I used JavaScript,HTML, and CSS in this project.
